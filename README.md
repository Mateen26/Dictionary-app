### `Description:`

The Dictionary Project is a web application that allows users to search for word definitions. It leverages the power of React and Tailwind CSS to provide a user-friendly and responsive dictionary experience.

### `Features:`

Word Definitions: Users can enter a word and instantly retrieve its definition from a reliable dictionary API.
Theme Switcher: Users can toggle between dark and light themes to customize the visual appearance of the application.
Font Selector: Users have the ability to switch between serif, sans-serif, and monospace fonts to personalize their reading experience.

### `Technologies Used:`

React: The application is built using the React JavaScript library, providing a modular and efficient component-based structure.
Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is used for styling the user interface, providing a utility-first approach and enabling rapid development.
External APIs: The project integrates with an external dictionary API for word definitions.
How It Works:

User Interface: The application consists of multiple components, such as the Header, Dictionary, and ThemeContextProvider, which are responsible for different functionalities and user interactions.
Word Definitions: When a user enters a word in the search input, the application sends a request to the dictionary API, retrieves the definition, and displays it on the screen.
Theme Switching: The theme switcher component updates the application's theme based on user interaction. It toggles between dark and light themes, adjusting the colors and styling accordingly.
Font Selection: The font selector component allows users to choose between serif, sans-serif, and monospace fonts. When a font is selected, the application updates the font style across relevant components.
The Dictionary Project provides a seamless and intuitive way to explore word definitions, offering users a rich and customizable dictionary experience.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
